			//reference types copy a reference (kind of like a website address) to the object when one object is put = another
			//this means that when you change the value in one it changes in any copies of it because they are all the same 
			//actual object (Say a website has multiple addresses and you change the content all the addresses now point to 
			//the new content)

			y = y + x;

			z.Real = 1f;

			//prints out new z
			Console.WriteLine ("z = " + z);
			//prints out y
			Console.WriteLine ("y = " + y);
			//notice y hasn't changed even though we changed z after making it a copy of y
			//this is because structs are what we call data types
			//data types copy the values instead of the location of the values
			//this is very useful in mathematical programs and games
