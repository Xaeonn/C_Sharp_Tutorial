Lesson 1 
================  
When you start programming it can all be quite overwhelming, between variables, control statements, loops, methods, classes, and so many keywords. My goal is to try and simplify this somewhat.

##Variables
Variables are the heart of C#, and indeed many other languages. It can be easy to get lost the first time you encounter them, experienced programmers are so used to using them they often 
forget to explain them properly. <br>
Any variable will be declared like this:<br>
```
variable_type name_of_variable;
```
eg.
```
int number;
```
This is telling the computer to create a variable of type int, integers (whole numbers), with the name number. Variables can also be declared with values assigned to them on creation:
```
variable_type name_of_variable = value;
```
eg.
```
int number = 9;
```
